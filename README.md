## Project Overview

This project serves as an educational example to explain the implementation of a basic client-server architecture with Socket.IO for real-time communication. It includes structured logging, error handling, and testing.

The application demonstrates:
- How to set up a Node.js server with Socket.IO.
- Basic real-time communication between multiple clients.
- Implementation of a layered architecture with a focus on modularity and separation of concerns.
- Proper logging and error handling practices.
- Automated testing for the server and socket interactions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdennabi-ahrrabi/client-server-architecture_simple-chat-app.git
   cd client-server-architecture_simple-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open a browser and connect to the server:**
   The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Client Interaction:**
   - Open two browser tabs or clients to test the chat functionality.
   - Send messages from one client and observe them being broadcast to the other.

## Architecture and Design

This project follows a layered architecture pattern, separating concerns into different layers:

1. **Controllers**: Manages the business logic related to socket events.
2. **Middlewares**: Handles error processing and any request pre-processing.
3. **Models**: Defines data models (if a database is used).
4. **Routes**: Defines HTTP routes for the RESTful API (if required).
5. **Services**: Provides utility functions like logging.
6. **Socket Handler**: Manages the socket connection and events.

## Testing

1. **Run all tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Test Coverage:**
   - Unit tests cover basic HTTP routes and socket interactions.
   - Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected.

## Logging and Error Handling

- **Logging**: Logs are managed using Winston, with log levels configurable via environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware ensures that all errors are logged and appropriate responses are sent to the client.

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage configuration settings. The following variables are available:

- `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The level of logging to be used (`info`, `debug`, etc.).
